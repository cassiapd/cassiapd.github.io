<h3 id="Vibes"> Mapua's best Muesli</h3>
<img class ="img-responsive" src="images/Mapua.jpg" alt="A vibrant vegan muesli">
<p> This muesli is from Alberta's it is called the Quinoa and Buckwheat granola seved with coconut yoghurt, seasonal fruits and a mylk of choice. It costs $16.20. I personally I'm not a big fan of coconut yoghurt and muesli but the fruit and presentation was great! My fmaily went in the middle of winter but the sun was still shinning, I was still chilly though. There are lovely views of the wharf and Rabbit Island aswell as being a popular spot for peope to bring their friendly dogs.  </p>  
    
<h3> A freezing Açai in Napier </h3>
<img class ="img-responsive" src="images/Hapi.jpg" alt="A a stunning acai bowl with lots of different toppings">
<p> This delicious açai bowl is from Hapī Clean Kai Co-op in Hasting St in Nelson. It is $14 which in my opinion is pretty good for a organic smoothie bowl. I like the fact that all their packaging is compostable and that they actually do compost it, but they did not accept our container for my smoothie bowl. The seating is quite cramped as it only one high bench facing the wall not very good for large groups. The decor was nice but it is down a street so it was quite cold and sunless. </p>  
    
    
<h3 id="taste"> My first Vegan croissant</h3>
<img class ="img-responsive" src="images/Mirimar.jpg" alt="A chocolate croissant on a woodboard">
<p> This incredible croissant is from Nicoletta's in Mirimar, Wellington. This is the first croissant I have had since going vegan and I even went to a French speaking country. The croissant costs $ it is rich but not very filling. Personally the atmosphere of the cafe was  ice but a bit chilly and not many people were there. But overall a great selection of local unique vegan eats. </p>  
    
    
<h3> Another açai - but by the beach! </h3>
<img class ="img-responsive" src="images/Mount.jpg" alt="A a stunning acai bowl with lots of different toppings">
<p> I'm very picky about acai's, I like them a certain way and this was not one of them. I was already annoyed as we were on the main strip of cafe's at Mt Maunganui Beach and it was a pretty cold day. We had gone into multiple cafes and nothing served vegan options but my family was set on this one place so we asked, seeing as they couldn't accomidate me, if I could bring food from anoithers cafe there. After looking all over the only place that has vegan options is Swell. The price of the acai bowl was very expensive and it had the worst dried fruit - goji berries. Also it was not acai weather. </p>  
    
    
<h3> An Ohope muesli </h3>
<img class ="img-responsive" src="images/Ohope.jpg" alt="A muesli in a jar with strawberry toppings">
<p> This is muesli is from the Moxi Cafe in Ohope. It was a basic muesli with coconut yogurth (we already know this isn't a fav of mine) and is towards the upper emd of the price range. The environment was very nice, the cafe is in a old container ship and can change the roof depending on the weather. It was a light friendly environment. The actual muesli wasn't that nice and neither was the drink I ordered. A green juice in plastic :( with chunks of kale in it. </p>  
    
    
<h3 id="looks"> Facon pancakes at the mount! </h3>
<img class ="img-responsive" src="images/Banana_Bacon.jpg" alt="Golden pancakes with banana on top with pieces of facon">
<p> This is the best breakfast I have had in a long time. I have really wanted to go to this cafe for a longtime, and I finally convinced my mum for us to have breakfast here. We went in an Mum was not convinced as it was down a side street an quite gloomy, just then the waitress mentions all the tables in the courtyard are free. The sun was pouring into the garden on the beautiful morning so a 10/10 for setting. The pancakes themselves were quite rich but very delicious and a generous amount of Maple Syrup which I often find is an issue with pancakes.  </p>
